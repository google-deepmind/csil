This repository contains an implementation of [coherent soft imitation learning (CSIL)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16498),
published at [NeurIPS 2023](https://openreview.net/forum?id=kCCD8d2aEu).

We also provide implementations of other 'soft'
imitation learning (SIL) algorithms: [Inverse soft Q-learning (IQ-Learn)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12142) and [proximal
point imitation learning (PPIL)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10968).

## Content
The implementation is built on top of [Acme](https://github.com/google-deepmind/acme) and follows their agent structure.

## Usage

Before running any code, first activate the conda environment and set the
`PYTHONPATH`:
```bash
conda activate csil
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/..
```

To run CSIL with default settings:
```bash
python scripts/run_csil.py
```
This runs the online version of CSIL on HalfCheetah-v2.

The experiment configurations for each algorithm (CSIL, IQ-Learn, and PPIL), can
be adjusted via the flags defined at the start of `run_*.py`.

The available tasks (specified with the `--env_name` flag) are:
```
HalfCheetah-v2
Ant-v2
Walker2d-v2
Hopper-v2
Humanoid-v2
door-v0         # Adroit hand
hammer-v0       # Adroit hand
pen-v0          # Adroit hand
```

The default setting is online soft imitation learning. To run the offline
version on the Adroit door task, for example:
```bash
python scripts/run_{algo_name}.py --offline=True --env_name=door-v0
```
replacing `{algo_name}` with either csil, iqlearn, or ppil.

We have also included a Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/csil/blob/master/scripts/soft_policy_iteration.ipynb) that reproduces
the discrete grid world experiments shown in the paper, for a range of imitation learning algorithms.

We highly encourage the use of accelerators (i.e. GPUs, TPUs) for CSIL. As CSIL requires a larger policy architecture, it has a slow wallclock time if run only on CPUs.

For a reproduction of the paper's experiment, [see this Weights & Biases project](https://wandb.ai/jmw125/csil/workspace).

The additional imitiation learning baselines shown in the paper [are available in Acme](https://github.com/google-deepmind/acme/tree/master/examples/baselines/imitation). 

### Open issues

[Distribued Acme experiments currently do not finish cleanly, so they appear as 'Crashed' on W&B when they finish successfully.](https://github.com/google-deepmind/acme/issues/312#issue-1990249288)

The robomimic experiments are currently not open-sourced.

## Installation

First clone this code repository into a local directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/google-deepmind/csil.git
cd csil
```

We recommend installing required dependencies inside a
[conda environment](https://www.anaconda.com/). To do this, first install
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download#downloads) and then create and
activate the conda environment:
```bash
conda create --name csil python=3.9
conda activate csil
```
CSIL is written in JAX, so first install the correct version of JAX for your system by [following the installation instructions](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).
Acme requires `jax 0.4.3` and will install that version. This may need to be uninstalled for a CUDA-based JAX installation, e.g.
```bash
pip install jax==0.4.7 https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/cuda12/jaxlib-0.4.7+cuda12.cudnn88-cp39-cp39-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl
```

MuJoCo must also be installed, in order to load the environments. Please follow
the instructions [here](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py#install-mujoco) to
install the MuJoCo binary and place it in a directory where `mujoco-py` can find
it.
This installation uses `mujoco200`, `gym < 0.24.0` and `mujoco-py 2.0.2.5` for compatibility reasons.

Then install `pip` and use it to install all the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To verify the installation, run
```bash
python -c "import jax.numpy as jnp; print(jnp.ones((1,)).device); import acme; import mujoco_py; import gym; print(gym.make('HalfCheetah-v2').reset())"
```
If this fails, follow the guidance below. 

## Troubleshooting

If you get the error
```
Command conda not found
```
then you need to add the folder where Anaconda is installed to your `PATH`
variable:
```bash
export PATH=/path/to/anaconda/bin:$PATH
```

If you get the error
```
ImportError: libpython3.9.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```
first activate the conda environment and then add it to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`:
```bash
conda activate csil
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:$CONDA_PREFIX/lib"
```

If you get the error
```
cannot find -lGL: No such file or directory
```
then install libGL with:
```
sudo apt install libgl-dev
```


If you get the error
```
fatal error: GL/glew.h: No such file or directory
```
then you need to install the following in your conda environment and update the
`CPATH`:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge glew
conda install -c conda-forge mesalib
conda install -c menpo glfw3
export CPATH=$CONDA_PREFIX/include
```

If you get the error
```
ImportError: libgmpxx.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```
then you need to install the following in your conda environment and update the
`CPATH`:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge gmp
export CPATH=$CONDA_PREFIX/include
```
If you get the error
```commandline
ImportError: ../lib/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.30' not found (required by /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libLLVM-15.so.1)
```
try
```commandline
mv libstdc++.so.6 libstdc++.so.6.old
ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6 libstdc++.so.6
```
